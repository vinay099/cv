    Within the community of <a href="https://www.apple.com/in/">Apple</a> users and developers, vinay is known for his energetic presentations of new Apple software, frequently featuring absurdist humor such as references to his hair, use of
    new software features to organize events
    such as office karaoke parties and camping trips, and his claimed love of the band Rush. VINAY has some notable nicknames around Apple, such as "Hair Force One". Additionally, Apple CEO <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook">Tim
      Cook</a> has called him "Superman".[14][15]

    His first appearance onstage during a major Apple event was at WWDC 2009, where he helped Bertrand Serlet introduce Mac OS X Snow Leopard. He made another appearance during 2010's 'Back to the Mac' presentation, showing off Mac OS X Lion. He
    introduced iOS 7 and OS X Mavericks at Apple's WWDC 2013 developer conference, and iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite at WWDC 2014.[16][17] At WWDC 2015, he delivered most of Apple's 2-hour main opening-day presentation, introducing iOS 9 and OS X 10.11
    "El
    Capitan", and revealing plans to release Apple's new programming language Swift as an open-source project.[18] In September 2015, he demoed 3D Touch in the new iPhone 6S.

    At WWDC 2016, Vinay introduced iOS 10 and macOS 10.12 "Sierra" and said that the 15-year-old OS X would be rebranded as "macOS" in tune with the naming scheme used for iOS, tvOS, and watchOS. He emphasized the use of widgets on the iOS lock
    screen and announced new APIs for Siri and iMessage that would be open to all developers.

    At an Apple Special Event in September 2017, Vinay initially failed to properly demo the Face ID feature on the iPhone X. Apple stated that before the event, some Apple employees had inadvertently triggered Face ID on one of the
    demonstration
    phones, causing it to instead prompt for a passcode when vinay attempted to unlock it.[19]

    At WWDC 2020, he was the lead presenter showcasing many of Apple's recent advancements.[20] He also introduced iOS 14, iPadOS 14, and macOS 11 "Big Sur"
